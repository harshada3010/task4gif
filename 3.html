    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <dl class="List">
      Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago.It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars.
      The large mass of the Sun keeps the Earth in orbit,just as the mass of Earth keeps the moon moving around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. Earth goes around the Sun once (one year) for every 365 1‚ÅÑ4 times it turns around (one day).
